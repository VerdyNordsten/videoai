## Summary of Changes

I've successfully reworked the login and register pages with a new modern animated design that uses the same social media icons as the orbit section in the landing page.

### Components Created

1. **Modern Animated Sign-In Component** (`src/components/blocks/modern-animated-sign-in.tsx`):
   - Created a new component with animated orbiting social media icons (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Facebook, Snapchat)
   - Used the same color scheme and styling as the landing page orbit section
   - Implemented ripple effects and floating animations
   - Created reusable components like Input, BoxReveal, Ripple, OrbitingCircles, TechOrbitDisplay, AnimatedForm, AuthTabs, Label, and BottomGradient

2. **Demo Component** (`src/components/blocks/demo.tsx`):
   - Created a demo page to showcase the new login component
   - Used the same social media icons as the landing page

### Updates Made

1. **Global CSS** (`src/app/globals.css`):
   - Added animation keyframes for ripple and orbit effects

2. **Login Form Component** (`src/components/auth/login-form.tsx`):
   - Updated to use the new modern animated sign-in component
   - Integrated social media icons from the landing page
   - Maintained all existing functionality (sign in/sign up modes, form validation, etc.)

3. **Missing UI Components**:
   - Created Input component (`src/components/ui/input.tsx`)
   - Created Label component (`src/components/ui/label.tsx`)

4. **Dashboard Layout** (`src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/layout.tsx`):
   - Fixed import issues by using API routes instead of direct server function imports

### Features

- Modern animated orbiting social media icons on the left side
- Clean, responsive form on the right side
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Consistent styling with the rest of the application
- Full functionality for both login and registration
- Form validation and error handling
- Social login options
- Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop

### Technologies Used

- React with TypeScript
- Next.js App Router
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion for animations
- React Icons for social media icons
- Lucide React for other icons

The new login and register pages now have a modern, animated design that matches the aesthetic of the landing page, with orbiting social media icons that create a visually engaging experience for users.

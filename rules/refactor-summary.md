# Naming Convention Refactor Summary

## Task Completed
I've successfully refactored the project to ensure consistent naming conventions according to best practices for React/Next.js projects.

## Changes Made
1. **File Naming Consistency**: 
   - Renamed `src/components/landing/Navbar.tsx` to `src/components/landing/navbar.tsx`
   - This ensures all component files follow the kebab-case naming convention

## Rules Established
I've created two rule files in the `rules` directory:
1. `naming-conventions.md` - Documenting the project's naming conventions
2. `refactor-plan.md` - Detailing the specific changes made

## Verification
- All component files in the project now consistently use kebab-case for file names
- Component names within the files correctly use PascalCase
- No breaking changes were introduced since the Navbar component was not used elsewhere
- The project structure now aligns with React/Next.js best practices

The project is now consistent with naming conventions and ready for further development.
